# T-Rex Game
Who hasn't experienced that moment of quiet disappointment when the internet goes down, only to be greeted by the plucky T-Rex standing against a blank desert? Suddenly, our outage becomes an unexpected adventure as we jump into the endless, addictive world of the Chrome Dino Game. 

This project is a nostalgic tribute to that unforgettable offline companion. Reimagined with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this game brings back the thrill of dodging cacti, jumping over obstacles, and striving for that elusive high scoreâ€”no Wi-Fi required!

Whether you're here to relive memories or simply looking for a fun challenge, step back into the desert and get ready to run with the T-Rex!
